The colab file is the latest version in this project, we can run colab file in google colab or VScode.
The input and output video files are given for example, we have given query "Cow" for the input video and we got only "Cow" scenes in the output.
First we have to run frame_extraction and feature_extraction before running the colab file.
We can change the URL or path of the input video in the first block of code.
